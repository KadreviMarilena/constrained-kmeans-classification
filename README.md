# Constrained K-Means Classification (Data Mining Project)

This project implements the **Constrained K-Means (C-K-Means)** algorithm in MATLAB as part of a **Data Mining** project.  
It extends the classic K-Means clustering method by introducing constraints (hyper-cubes) and a weighted Euclidean distance for improved clustering accuracy and classification performance.

## Description

- **Goal:** Cluster and classify real-world datasets using the Constrained K-Means algorithm.
- **Datasets used:**
  - **Iris Dataset**
  - **Wine Dataset**
  - **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)**
  - **Abalone Dataset**

Each dataset was preprocessed, numerically encoded (where needed), and split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

## Technologies

- **Programming Language:** MATLAB
- **Field:** Data Mining, Machine Learning
- **Algorithms:** K-Means, Constrained K-Means (C-K-Means)

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary

| Dataset                  | Accuracy |
| ------------------------ | -------- |
| Iris                     | ~91%     |
| Wine                     | ~71%     |
| Breast Cancer Wisconsin  | ~90%     |

The Constrained K-Means implementation achieves strong classification accuracy by combining clustering with class constraints.
